#### Project Member: Diego Fernandez (df356)
#### Class Code: ORIE 4160

## Project Description:
Throughout the report we will perform an analysis of traffic flow in New York City's Broadway area, with a focus on predicting daily traffic volumes. 

The goal is to leverage these predictions to enhance urban planning and reduce congestion. 

We will implement several techniques learnt in class, evaluate their performance, and discuss their potential implementation in practical settings.
